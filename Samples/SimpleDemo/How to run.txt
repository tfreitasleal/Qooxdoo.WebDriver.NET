If you don't want to run the Web Application project, jump to step 3.
In this case you will be able to run only the first 4 tests that target the qooxdoo API viewer.

1. Get Wisej at http://wisej.com
2. Set Wisej.SimpleDemo as Startup Project.

3. Build the solution so all NuGet packages are restored.
5. Run it (CTRL F5) to start IIS Express.
4. Open a test session and run all the tests.

N.B. - Sometimes you must repeat the tests untill all is "green" (Firefox is the worst case).

One word of advise. Sometimes the WebDrivers continue executing on the background and you must kill them on the Task Manager.
They show on the Task Manager by the following names:
- Microsoft Web Driver for Edge
- chromedriver.exe for Chrome
- geckodriver.exe for Firefox
